#Placement Prediction based on CGPA using Simple Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting placement outcomes solely based on CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) using simple linear regression.

Overview
In the context of campus placements, predicting whether a candidate will be placed or not based on their CGPA can provide valuable insights to both students and recruiters. This project explores the feasibility of using CGPA as the sole predictor for placement prediction, employing simple linear regression.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about candidates' CGPA and their corresponding placement status. The dataset includes the following columns:

CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average of the candidate
Placement Status: Binary variable indicating whether the candidate got placed (1) or not (0)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and checked for any missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the distribution of CGPA and its relationship with placement status.
Model Building: Implemented simple linear regression using CGPA as the independent variable and placement status as the dependent variable.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RohitRaj234/placement-prediction-using-simple-LinearRegression/edit/main/README.md
Install Dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:
Open and run the placement_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the step-by-step implementation and results.

Results
The simple linear regression model achieved promising results in predicting placement outcomes based solely on CGPA. Detailed insights and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using CGPA as a predictor for placement prediction. While CGPA alone may not capture all factors influencing placement outcomes, it can still serve as a useful tool for preliminary screening in recruitment processes.
